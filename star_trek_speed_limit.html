      <strong>The Universal Speed Limit</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        In the previous section, we keep talking about this 'Univeral Speed Limit' and that is is a major contraint on much of modern science fiction. But what is this limit and why is it so important?
    </p>

    <p>
        The universal speed limit, also sometimes referred to as the faster-than-light (FTL) limit, is a product of Einstein's theory of special relativity, which explores the relationship between space and time.<sup>5</sup> His theory is based on two postulates, or assumptions:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>The laws of physics do not change between frames of reference that are inertial, or have no acceleration. That is to say that physics will behave the same, no matter if you are in a spaceship travelling a (very high) constant velocity, or standing still on the Earth </li>
        <li>The speed of light is a constant, so does not change depending on how you are moving</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        Using these two postulates, Einstein aimed to explain the physics behing fast moving objects (in the absense of gravity, that would then be moving into general relativity). It revolutionised our understanding of time and space, showing the two are fundamentally connected, rather than seperate entities. Einstein introduced a mathematical factor called the Lorentz factor, which is a function of the speed of the object of interest. It is expressed as:
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 2.2em;">
        $\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$
    </p>

    <p>
        Here, c is the speed of light, which is $3.00 \cdot 10^8 ms^{-1}$. So as your velocity increases, this factor gets larger and larger, approaching infinity. A new expression for the kinetic energy of a moving object was produced, multiplying the classical energy by the Lorentz factor, so as your speed gets closer to the speed of light your energy gets closer to infinity. It seems obvious to assume that one cannot have infinite energy, with the total energy of the universe being constant and finite, meaning it is impossible to travel faster, or even at, the speed of light. 
    </p>

    <p>
        It is easier to visualise this graphically. <em>Add some more description</em>
    </p>

    <figure class="image-row" style="height:400px">

    </figure>
    <figure class="center-image">
      <figcaption>Graph showing how energy requirements change as your speed increases, both classically and then using Einstein's relativistic correction</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
        Further, out of special relativity came possibly Einstein's most famous equation<sup>5</sup>, which you will have seen before:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 2.0em;">
        $E = m \cdot c^2$
    </p>
    <p>
        Here, Einstein is saying that energy and mass are essentially the same thing. The total energy of an object travelling at speed is a combination of both its kinetic energy (calculated from its speed) and the rest mass. In Star Trek, starships hold a crew of many hundreds of people, along with hundreds of rooms, technology and everything needed for a crew to survive longs periods in space. While a figure is never given in the show, it is safe to assume the mass of a starship is huge. Amongst fans, the most commonly accepted alue is 190,000 tons, which is around 190 million kg. This is almost twice the mass of the US's largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, or around 19 Eiffel Towers. So now consider just how much energy would be needed for the USS Enterprise to travel even remotely close to the speed of light, never mind almost the speed of light or at superluminal speeds.
