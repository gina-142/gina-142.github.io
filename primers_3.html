    <strong>The tyranny of special relativity</strong>
  </p>

<p>The final tyranny of spaceflight is time dilation. This is explored in depth in 
  the context of warp drives in the Star Trek section, but for completeness, we 
  will discuss it briefly here.</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.8em; text-align: left;">
    <strong>Einstein's postulates</strong>
  </p>
<p>In 1905, the so-called <em>Annus Mirabilis</em>, Einstein published three groundbreaking
  papers. One on the photoelectric effect - a phenomena with far-reaching consequences that would 
lay down the groundwork for quantum theory - another on Brownian motion, and one entitled <em>On the electrodynamics of moving bodies</em>.</p>
    <p>This would prove to be foundational for our modern interpretation of time.</p>

<p>Assuming two key postulates, which experimental analysis support:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">
- That the laws of physics are the same for all inertial (constant velocity) observers
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">
- That the speed of light is the same for all observers - if you move towards a beam of light the speed at which you perceive it to be approaching doesn't change
</p>
<p>Einstein uncovered deeper truths about the nature of time. Namely, that it is relative, much like position.</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.8em; text-align: left;">
    <strong>Time dilation</strong>
  </p>
<p>A consequence of these postulates, which may be determined by appeal to Pythagoras and relatively straightforward algebra, 
    is that time elapsed for a moving person is different to that of a stationary observer. It is the concept, not the mathematics that is tricky.</p>
<p>The relationship is as follows:</p>


<p>\[
t = \gamma t_0
\]</p>

<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>\( t \) = time elapsed for a stationary observer</li>
  <li>\( t_0 \) = "proper" time elapsed by the moving person</li>
  <li>\( \gamma \) = the so-called "Lorentz factor"</li>
</ul>
<p>The Lorentz factor is defined as:</p>

<p>\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]</p>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>\( v \) = is the velocity of the moving person</li>
  <li>\( c \) = is the speed of light</li>
</ul>


<p>This reciprocal relationship (essentially gamma being 1 divided by something) means that as \( v \) approaches \( c \), the Lorentz factor tends to infinity. It gets arbitrarily large.</p>
<p>The consequence is that, as one's speed approaches the speed of light - which is essentially the cosmic speed limit - the Lorentz factor becomes huge, and so
  the time elapsed by the stationary observer gets longer and longer, proportionally to the time elapsed by the traveller.</p>
<p>A space traveller may therefore travel at high speeds and across vast distance, but at the expense that the universe ages dramatically, during what may feel like a very short period of travel.</p>
<p>This is before we even consider the dramatic energy costs that such speed would require.</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.8em; text-align: left;">
    <strong>Time dilation in science fiction</strong>
  </p>
<p>Science fiction creates workarounds, like the Star Trek warpdrive. But, in other 
  media, such time-dilation is an integral part of the plot. This is evidenced in the Queen song, '39, 
  one of the few songs that Brian May - himself an astrophysicist - is the lead vocallists.</p>
<p>Science fiction is generally happy to work around these constraints by creating novel technologies. 
  This is no better exemplified by Star Trek's warp drive or Star Wars' hyperspace.</p>
<p>However, some media exploits this fact of nature and leverages it as a narrative tool.</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.8em; text-align: left;">
    <strong><em>'39</em> by Queen</strong>
  </p>


<p>Queen's song, <em>'39</em>, was written by their guitarist, Brian May - who also holds a PhD in astrophysics. It is one of the few songs on which he is the lead vocallists. Before we discuss further, we urge you strongly to give it a listen.</p>

<p>It is heavily inspired by May's astrophysics background and depicts time dilation. The song relates the tale of a group of astronauts who embark on a year-long journey, close to the speed of light. Upon their return, however, everyone on Earth has aged.</p>
<div class="big-quote">    
<p>In the year of '39 assembled here, the Volunteers<br>
In the days when lands were few<br>
Here the ship sailed out into the blue and sunny morn<br>
Sweetest sight ever seen<br>
And the night followed day, and the storytellers say<br>
That the score brave souls inside, <br>
For many a lonely day<br>
Sailed across the milky seas<br>
Ne’er looked back, never feared, never cried</p>


<p>Don't you hear my call?<br>
Though you're many years away<br>
Don't you hear me calling you?<br>
Write your letters in the sand<br>
For the day I take your hand<br>
In the land that our grandchildren knew</p>




<p>In the year of '39<br>
Came a ship in from the blue<br>
The Volunteers came home that day<br>
And they bring good news<br>
Of a world so newly born<br>
Though their hearts so heavily weight<br>
For the Earth is old and grey<br>
Little darling, we'll away but, my love, this cannot be<br>
For so many years are gone<br>
Though I'm older but a year<br>
Your mother's eyes from your eyes cry to me<p>

<p>Don't you hear my call?<br>
Though you're many years away<br>
Don't you hear me calling you?<br>
Write your letters in the sand<br>
For the day I take your hand<br>
In the land that our grandchildren knew</p>


<p>Don't you hear my call?<br>
Though you're many years away<br>
Don't you hear me calling you?<br>
All your letters in the sand<br>
Cannot heal me like your hand<br>
For my life, still ahead, pity me</p>
</div>
<p>It is a poignant song. Although they have only aged a year, a hundred years have passed on Earth and their loved ones have since aged dramaticaly or died.</p>
