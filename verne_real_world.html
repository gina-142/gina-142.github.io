    <strong>Real World</strong>
  </p>
  <p>While Jules Verne’s Columbiad ultimately would not be able to launch a human crew into space, scientists haven’t stopped trying to adapt his idea into reality. Using modern developments in physics, including stronger materials and a better understanding of electromagnetism, space guns have been taken in other, even more outlandish directions.</p>

  <p>Looking at the SpinLaunch system, its resemblance to a cannon is undeniable. Although only a one-third scale model has been constructed so far, the results have been promising, and a full system is in development. So how does it work?</p>
  <p>Instead of propelling the payload via a chemical explosion, SpinLaunch – as the name implies – spins the payload up to a speed of 7,500 km/h in an enormous centrifuge before releasing it vertically, launching it into space. In Verne’s time, such a device would not have been possible, as the strain placed on the centrifuge arm is beyond the strength of 19th century materials; however, modern vacuum technology allows the payload to be spun up in an airless environment, greatly reducing strain as the centrifuge does not have to push air out of the way, while new materials like carbon fibre are able to withstand the forces involved. Although significantly less than in the Columbiad, the G forces involved are not to be sniffed at, reaching up to 10,000 Gs, more than enough to liquify any human passengers. This does not necessarily spell doom for SpinLaunch, as it could launch rockets high into the atmosphere at lower velocities, allowing them to independently complete the acceleration at a safe rate. But this would come at the cost of severely reduced weight limits: such a rocket could only carry 200 kg, much less than – for example – the 4000 kg of the Apollo Lunar Lander. So it seems that SpinLaunch, like the Columbiad, could not launch humans to the Moon.</p>

  </figure>
  <p>Enter the mass driver. First hypothesised in 1950 by Arthur C Clarke, and featuring in many sci-fi works since, mass drivers are a type of launch system that takes the opposite approach to SpinLaunch, extending Verne’s space gun out to kilometres in length while retaining smooth acceleration throughout. Although still only theoretical, a mass driver would work like a Shinkansen train, using electromagnetic repulsion from coils spaced along a track to accelerate a magnetic payload over a great distance, meaning its acceleration can be much gentler while still reaching the same final speed. The only downsides are the high electrical energy required to power the electromagnets along the track and the upfront cost of construction, but these quickly pay for themselves, particularly in a space-based environment. For this reason, mass drivers have been proposed as a great way to launch rockets containing valuable resources from the surface of the moon for use on Earth.</p>

    <strong>Project HARP</strong>
  </p>

  <p>The High Altitude Research Project was first conceived by Gerald Bull, a reknowned Canadian engineer. It was a joint effort between the US DoD and Canada's Department of National Defence. It was an attempt to explore the ballistics of re-entry vehicles. To be cost-effective, it fired projectiles into the atmosphere using very high-power guns.</p>
  <p>Taking place from 1962 to 1967, a 16-inch gun used during the project holds the record for the highest altitude attained by a gun-fired projectile. It reached over 180km, comfortably above the Kárman (100km) which is legally defined to be the edge of space.</p>
