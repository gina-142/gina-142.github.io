      <strong>Concerns Over Potential Spaghettification</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      When the discussion of space-time distortion is had, one must discuss the horrific concept of spaghettification, when the difference in gravity at one point of a person is so great to that of another that they begin to be stretched, until they become as thin as a single strand of molecules. This is due to an effect called Tidal Forces, often found near black holes with huge gravity differentials. Since the Alcubierre Warp Drive relies on contracting space-time in front of the ship and expanding space-time behind it, the question is "How do we prevent the crew from getting spaghettified?"; any warp-drive mechanism must not only consider the problem of displacing a large mass from one end of the universe to another, but also must act to preserve the ship and crew in doing so. The answer to this lies in the so-called 'warp bubble', which creates a flat region of space-time trapped within the curvature created around it. This prevents the catastrophic internal tidal forces and thus the spaghettification of any crew. However, this  protection comes at the cost of extreme space-time curvature at the boundary of the bubble, where energy densities become enormous and the stability becomes uncertain. The theoretical viability of the warp drives becomes less one of exceeding light speed locally, but in engineering space-time geometry in which tidal forces are isolated and life within appears feasible.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this respect, the warp drive exemplifies the broader dialogue between fiction and physics. A narrative requirement (that a crew travel faster than light without being torn apart) becomes, instead, a precise demand on spacetime curvature and stress-energy distributions. The fictional premise sets the constraint, which must then be satisfied in line with general relativity and all-know physical laws. The resulting solution can neither be described as purely imaginative nor practical engineering, but is a demonstration into how speculative fiction can spark mathematically rigorous questions about the structure of space-time itself and our ability to manipulate it.

      <strong>The Symbiotic Nature of Fact and Fiction</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        The barrier between reality and fiction can often seem blurred, so with the advent of science fiction becoming a mainstream media format, a question begins to arise. Do we base our Science Fiction on real world physics, or do we build our scientific exploration with media as inspiration? Star-Trek provides an interesting example to heavily imply that the latter is becoming our new normal. In 1994, Miguel Alcubierre Moya published a paper entitled “The Warp Drive: Hyper-Fast Travel Within General Relativity” explaining the principles of what has come to be known as the “Alcubierre Warp Drive” [1]. 

    </p>

    <p>
         Initially this investigation into the physics behind Warp Drives began as a “lark” [2], however, soon became more serious physics, translating the narrative device behind the show into a geometrical solution of Einstein’s equations within General Relativity. Alcubierre is stated to have emailed William Shatner – who famously portrayed Captain Kirk in all episodes of “Star Trek: The Original Series” – explaining his research and conceptualisation of his new warp drive was directly inspired by the show [2]. The paper was the turning point that led to the transition of FTL (Faster-Than-Light) travel from fiction to real physics, although it was impractical and reliant on exotic energy conditions, it violated no known physical laws [1]. This contribution to the scientific world sparked a whole new branch of physics called “Warp Drive Theory”. The inspiration of breakthroughs in spaceflight research from science fiction is not a rare phenomenon, further papers investigating different methods of Warp Travel have been inspired by Star Trek, H.G. Wells’ ‘The War of The Worlds’ is widely recognised as being a major inspiration for the development of fuel-propelled rockets. In many cases, the fiction behind the fact does not itself need to be scientifically accurate, but works to expand the conceptual space within which scientists are willing to explore and investigate.
