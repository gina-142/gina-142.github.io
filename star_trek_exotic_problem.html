      <strong>An Exotic Problem</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        One of the main problems with the Alcubierre drive – and why we unfortunately currently can't fly off into deep space like Captain Kirk – is that it requires negative energy behind the ship to ‘push’ the warp bubble along through normal spacetime. And not just a little, but a lot: the equivalent of a whole negative Jupiter! This is a serious problem for scientists interested in creating their own warp drive, as one of the fundamental principles of modern physics is that energy is always positive and always conserved (or more specifically, that energy density is never below zero), as otherwise our everyday assumptions about the world around us would go out the window and collapse into mathematical instability: if the energy of a ball rolling down a hill could be negative, why should it stop once it runs out of energy at the bottom, rather than accelerating forever – or indeed, spontaneously turning into an elephant?
    </p>
    <p>
        There are several ways physicists phrase this principle mathematically, from very strict to very lenient. The strictest, called the Strong Energy Condition, asserts that gravity must pull all observers together, regardless of distance. This is true for most of classical physics, such as classical mechanics and Newtonian gravitation; however, this version of the principle turns out to be too strict, as it is disproven by the continuing expansion of the universe: if the Strong Energy Condition were true, the universe would be shrinking, not expanding, and yet it is possible for two observers to never meet if they are far enough apart that the space between them is expanding faster than light. Physicists therefore relax the argument to the Weak Energy Condition, which is perhaps the most intuitive version, stating that no observer locally sees negative energy density – i.e., negative energy does not exist. While this version of the principle has been broken at quantum scales by experiments such as the Casimir effect, there is currently no proof that it can be broken at human scales, like we need for our warp drive. But all hope is not lost: some physicists argue for the existence of a type of ‘exotic matter’ that would allow us to break the rules.
    </p>
    <p>
       Exotic matter is a hypothetical matter that has 'weird' properties, such as negative mass or negative energy density. In Alcubierre's equation, as the variable SIGMA is increased – i.e., as the walls of the bubble thicken – the required amount of exotic matter increases.

      <strong>Concerns over Potential Spaghettification</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        Exotic matter is not the only problem linked to the reality of warp drives...
    </p>
        
    <p>
        When discussing powerful space-time distortion, it would be remiss to overlook the horrific concept of spaghettification. When the strength of gravity at one end of a person is much greater than the other end, they begin to be stretched apart, until they become as thin as a single strand of molecules, like human spaghetti. This is due to the effect of tidal forces – the same effect that causes the tides on Earth – which is another way of saying how quickly the strength of gravity changes near an object. Since the Alcubierre Warp Drive relies on a bubble whose walls are made of highly distorted spacetime, a very important question (if you don’t like being stretched into human pasta) is: “how do we prevent the crew from getting spaghettified?".

      Any warp-drive mechanism must not only consider the enormous problem of displacing a large mass from one place to another at reality-breaking speeds, but also do this without shredding everything inside. The answer to this lies in containing these effects within the exotic matter in the walls of the warp bubble, allowing for a safe region of spacetime trapped within the curvature created around it, preventing the catastrophic internal tidal forces from ripping apart the ship and the crew. Unfortunately, this protection comes at the cost of much more extreme spacetime curvature at the boundary of the bubble, where energy densities become enormous and the stability becomes uncertain. Not only does this more extreme curvature mean we need more negative energy (and therefore more hypothetical exotic matter), it also means that negative energy needs to be denser, leading to instability as it tries to escape the bubble’s walls in the form of intense heat and ionising radiation, baking the spaceship like a radioactive oven. In essence, the viability of the warp drives becomes less a problem of exceeding light speed, and more of engineering a bubble that balances keeping the walls thick enough to avoid cooking the crew but thin enough to avoid spaghettifying them. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In this respect, the warp drive exemplifies the broader dialogue between fiction and physics. A narrative requirement (that a crew travel faster than light without being torn apart) becomes, instead, a precise demand on spacetime curvature and stress-energy distributions. The fictional premise sets the constraint, which must then be satisfied in line with general relativity and all-know physical laws. The resulting solution can neither be described as purely imaginative nor practical engineering, but is a demonstration into how speculative fiction can spark mathematically rigorous questions about the structure of space-time itself and our ability to manipulate it.

      <strong>The Symbiotic Nature of Fact and Fiction</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        The barrier between reality and fiction can often seem blurred, so with the advent of science fiction becoming a mainstream media format, a question begins to arise. Do we base our Science Fiction on real world physics, or do we build our scientific exploration with media as inspiration? Star-Trek provides an interesting example to heavily imply that the latter is becoming our new normal. In 1994, Miguel Alcubierre Moya published a paper entitled “The Warp Drive: Hyper-Fast Travel Within General Relativity” explaining the principles of what has come to be known as the “Alcubierre Warp Drive” [1]. 

    </p>

    <p>
         Initially this investigation into the physics behind Warp Drives began as a “lark” [2], however, soon became more serious physics, translating the narrative device behind the show into a geometrical solution of Einstein’s equations within General Relativity. Alcubierre is stated to have emailed William Shatner – who famously portrayed Captain Kirk in all episodes of “Star Trek: The Original Series” – explaining his research and conceptualisation of his new warp drive was directly inspired by the show [2]. The paper was the turning point that led to the transition of FTL (Faster-Than-Light) travel from fiction to real physics, although it was impractical and reliant on exotic energy conditions, it violated no known physical laws [1]. This contribution to the scientific world sparked a whole new branch of physics called “Warp Drive Theory”. The inspiration of breakthroughs in spaceflight research from science fiction is not a rare phenomenon, further papers investigating different methods of Warp Travel have been inspired by Star Trek, H.G. Wells’ ‘The War of The Worlds’ is widely recognised as being a major inspiration for the development of fuel-propelled rockets. In many cases, the fiction behind the fact does not itself need to be scientifically accurate, but works to expand the conceptual space within which scientists are willing to explore and investigate.
