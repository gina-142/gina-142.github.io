      <strong>An Exotic Problem</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        One of the main problems with Alcubierre's drive, and why unfortunately we currently can't run off into deep space like Captain Kirk, is that it requires exotic matter. This is a hypothetical matter that has 'weird' properties, such as negative mass or negative energy density. In Alcubierr's equation, as the variable $\sigma$ is increased, i.e. the walls of the bubble thickens, there is an increase in the amount of exotic matter that would be needed to create the warp bubble.
    </p>

    <p>
        For normal matter and radiation in space, energy density if positive, resulting in expected results, such as objects attracting each other due to the effects of gravity. Energy density being a measure of the amount of energy stored in a given region of space, so for example black holes have a very high energy density, hundreds of trillions times more energy dense than Earth. Alcubierre's metric, due to the way it pulls in spacetime at the front of the bubble and pushes it outwards at the back, results in repulsive gravitational effects, implying a negative energy density.

      <strong>Concerns over Potential Spaghettification</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        Exotic matter is not the only problem linked to the reality of warp drives...
    </p>
        
    <p>
        When the discussion of space-time distortion is had, one must discuss the horrific concept of spaghettification, when the difference in gravity at one point of a person is so great to that of another that they begin to be stretched, until they become as thin as a single strand of molecules. This is due to an effect called Tidal Forces, often found near black holes with huge gravity differentials. Since the Alcubierre Warp Drive relies on contracting space-time in front of the ship and expanding space-time behind it, the question is "How do we prevent the crew from getting spaghettified?"; any warp-drive mechanism must not only consider the problem of displacing a large mass from one end of the universe to another, but also must act to preserve the ship and crew in doing so. The answer to this lies in the so-called 'warp bubble', which creates a flat region of space-time trapped within the curvature created around it. This prevents the catastrophic internal tidal forces and thus the spaghettification of any crew. However, this  protection comes at the cost of extreme space-time curvature at the boundary of the bubble, where energy densities become enormous and the stability becomes uncertain. The theoretical viability of the warp drives becomes less one of exceeding light speed locally, but in engineering space-time geometry in which tidal forces are isolated and life within appears feasible.

    <p>
        In this respect, the warp drive exemplifies the broader dialogue between fiction and physics. A narrative requirement (that a crew travel faster than light without being torn apart) becomes, instead, a precise demand on spacetime curvature and stress-energy distributions. The fictional premise sets the constraint, which must then be satisfied in line with general relativity and all-know physical laws. The resulting solution can neither be described as purely imaginative nor practical engineering, but is a demonstration into how speculative fiction can spark mathematically rigorous questions about the structure of space-time itself and our ability to manipulate it.
