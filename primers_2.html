    <strong>The tyranny of the rocket equation</strong>
  </p>

<p>The governing principle of rocketry is contained in Tsiolkovsky’s rocket equation,
  first published by the Russian rocket scientist Konstantin Tsiolkovsky in 1903 
  (although it was derived independently by William Moore in 1810 and later by Robert 
  Goddard and Hermann Oberth).</p>
<p>Its derivation requires substantial pernickety calculus. As such, we will 
  introduce it without justification, and through 
  heuristic build intuition into the inner workings of liquid propellant engines.</p>
<p>\[
\Delta v = v_e \text{ln} \frac{m_0}{m_f}
\]</p>    
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>\( \Delta v \) = the total change in the velocity of the rocket</li>
  <li>\( v_e \) = the exhaust velocity of the propellant - how quickly fuel is expelled</li>
  <li>\( m_0 \) = the initial mass of the rocket (including fuel)</li>
  <li>\( m_f \) = the final mass of the rocket (after fuel burn)</li>
</ul>

<p>The logarithm, \( \text{ln} \frac{m_0}{m_f} \)is the killer. For a small increase in velocity change, 
    you need exponentially more fuel.</p>

 <p style="font-size: 1.8em; text-align: left;">
    <strong>Momentum conservation</strong>
  </p>
<p>At heart, rocketry is simply an exercise of conservation of momentum. 
  Encased within Newton’s Third Law, the conservation of momentum states that 
  the momentum before an event is equal to the momentum after.</p>



<p>As a vector quantity, momenta in opposite directions have a cancelling effect.</p> 

<p>If at rest, the initial momentum of the rocket is zero. Thus, when the exhaust 
  leaves the rocket, it carries momentum downwards. In order for momentum to be
  conserved, the rocket must acquire momentum upwards.</p>
<p>This basic principle accounts for the upward motion as a response to fuel burning.</p>
 <p style="font-size: 1.8em; text-align: left;">
    <strong>Where science fiction cheats</strong>
  </p>

<p>Real rockets are highly fragile towers, burning vast quantities of fuel 
  per second just to claw upwards. To put this into perspective, approximately 90% of the 
  Saturn V’s total lift-off mass was propellant. Very real, very dangerous stuff.</p>
<p>No wonder Tom Wolfe, in his foreword to his classic, <em>The Right Stuff</em>, 
  was curious as to “what makes a man willing to
  sit up on top of an enormous Roman candle… and wait for someone to light the fuse.”</p>

<p>The rocket equation is the physical principle that necessitates vast quantities of fuel – 
  and a comparatively small empty rocket mass – to achieve escape velocity.</p>

<p>If escape velocity is the first physical tyranny of spaceflight, Tsiolkovsky’s rocket 
  equation is the second and the prime tyranny.</p>

<p>The final tyranny - special relativity and time dilation - is the object of speculative fiction. But it 
  may set a hard time limit on human spacefaring endeavours.</p>
