  <h1 id="title">Physics and the Final Frontier: A historical survey of spaceflight in science fiction</h1>

  <div id="main" style="padding-top: 90px;">
    <p style="font-size: 1.8em; text-align: left;">
      <strong>MISSION STATEMENT:</strong>
    </p>
<p><b>Greetings, traveller.</b></p>
<p>Spaceflight is a modern expression of the long tradition of human boundary pushing. From Christopher Columbus to Roald Amundsen, to Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, the restless human spirit has continuously driven us towards unknown frontiers. Ocean and ice have been substituted for vacuum and stardust.</p>
<p>Science fiction continues in this vein. In some instances, it fantastically pushes the boundaries of the imagination, but in others it seriously attempts extrapolation from the scientific status quo. With various degrees of rigour, sci-fi offers us valuable insight into what we could be. Some consider spaceflight to be a cool, peripheral thing, but others frame it – as in 2001: A Space Odyssey, or those who subscribe to a radical form of Turner's Frontier Thesis – as a natural and necessary component of human evolution. </p>
<p>Historical analysis itself is neither neutral nor objective. It is a human process of heuristic and narrative construction. As explored by former Chief Historian at NASA Dr. Roger D. Launius, with whom we join for an extended conversation, our conception of historical “turning points” are often misguided. Those moments which we take to be foundational, are very often not.</p> 
<p>This project constructs a consciously subjective narrative examining how spaceflight, as depicted within science fiction, has evolved alongside the real thing. We focus on three key case studies:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Early scientific realism and the work of Jules Verne.</li>
  <li>The mid-20th Century space western, Star Trek.</li>
  <li>Contemporary speculative but grounded realism of Interstellar.</li>
</ol>

<p>Within each case study, we examine the physics underlying methods of space travel. We explore both the mathematical foundations and the physical plausibility of such modes of exploration. From the liquifying acceleration of Verne's Columbiad – examined through the lens of Newtonian physics – to Kip Thorne's theoretical work underpinning Interstellar's wormhole, we are asking three key questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>How does the fictitious method of spaceflight work?</li>
  <li>Is it physically realistic?</li>
  <li>What is the historical and cultural context of this method, and what were the creators aims?</li>
</ol>
<p>We hope you will join us on this journey!</p>
<div class="big-quote">
    Space: the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds; to seek out new life and new civilizations; to boldly go where no man has gone before!

  (function () {
    var questionBank = [
      { text: "Kip Thorne won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on gravitational waves.", fact: true,
        explanation: "Thorne was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2017 — years after consulting on Interstellar. His theoretical work on gravitational waves was confirmed by the LIGO detector." },

      { text: "In Interstellar, the wormhole is located near Mars.", fact: false,
        explanation: "The wormhole is positioned near Saturn. Its proximity to a recognisable planet was a deliberate narrative choice, giving the crew a landmark for their journey." },

      { text: "Jules Verne launched his characters to the Moon using a giant cannon.", fact: true,
        explanation: "In From the Earth to the Moon (1865), the crew are fired from a colossal Columbiad cannon in Florida — a surprisingly accurate choice of launch site, if not launch method." },

      { text: "Einstein's theory of special relativity permits faster-than-light travel.", fact: false,
        explanation: "Special relativity shows that as an object with mass approaches the speed of light, the energy required becomes infinite. FTL travel for ordinary matter is therefore prohibited." },

      { text: "A traversable wormhole requires exotic matter with negative energy density to remain open.", fact: true,
        explanation: "The Morris-Thorne metric demonstrates that without exotic matter, gravity would force the wormhole throat to collapse — making it impassable." },

      { text: "The Alcubierre warp drive is prohibited by Einstein's general relativity.", fact: false,
        explanation: "The Alcubierre metric is actually a valid solution to Einstein's field equations. The problem is the exotic matter required — not the theory itself." },

      { text: "The wormhole in Interstellar appears as a flat circular portal on screen.", fact: false,
        explanation: "Thanks to accurate relativistic rendering by physicist Kip Thorne, the wormhole appears as a perfect sphere — light from behind it bends around all sides equally." },

      { text: "Star Trek first aired on television in 1966.", fact: true,
        explanation: "The Original Series premiered on NBC on 8 September 1966 and ran for three seasons, introducing warp drive, phasers, and the Prime Directive to popular culture." },

      { text: "Escape velocity from Earth is 27.1828 km/s.", fact: false,
        explanation: "Using v = √(2GM/r), the escape velocity at Earth's surface is about 11.2 km/s in an idealised scenario without air resistance." },

      { text: "The rocket equation shows that increasing exhaust velocity makes rockets more efficient.", fact: true,
        explanation: "A higher exhaust velocity directly increases the achievable change in velocity for the same mass ratio." },

      { text: "A rocket can accelerate in space even if there is no air to push against.", fact: true,
        explanation: "Rockets work by conservation of momentum. Expelling mass in one direction causes the rocket to gain momentum in the opposite direction so we don't need an atmosphere." },

      { text: "Time dilation means that a fast-moving astronaut ages more quickly than someone on Earth.", fact: false,
        explanation: "According to special relativity, a moving clock runs slower. The astronaut would age less than someone who remained stationary on Earth." },

      { text: "As a spacecraft’s speed approaches the speed of light, the energy required to accelerate it continues to increase dramatically.", fact: true,
        explanation: "As velocity approaches the speed of light, the Lorentz factor grows very large, meaning ever-increasing amounts of energy are required to increase speed further." },

      { text: "In Dune, human navigators use a substance called sugar cane to safely fold space.", fact: false,
        explanation: "The Dune bubble explains that navigators consume the Spice Melange to foresee safe routes when folding spacetime." },

      { text: "In Lensman, spaceships accelerate instantly without worrying about classical mechanics or relativity.", fact: true,
        explanation: "The Lensman entry states that inertialess drives allow ships to accelerate beyond light speed without concern for relativity or classical mechanics." },

      { text: "In 2001: A Space Odyssey, most scenes in space include loud engine noises for realism.", fact: false,
        explanation: "The bubble notes that much of the film is spent in total silence to reflect the vacuum of space." },

      { text: "In The Three-Body Problem, a payload is accelerated using a chain of nuclear explosions and a solar sail.", fact: true,
        explanation: "The bubble explicitly states that roughly 300 nuclear explosions are used to transfer momentum to a solar sail." },

      { text: "In Stargate, interstellar travel primarily takes place using small fixed wormholes only a few metres wide.", fact: true,
        explanation: "The Stargate bubble describes fixed wormholes a few metres wide that allow instantaneous travel." },

      { text: "In Alien, faster-than-light travel is achieved through hyperspace jumps into another dimension.", fact: false,
        explanation: "The Alien bubble describes displacement drives that displace space and accelerate gradually, not hyperspace travel." },

      { text: "In The Expanse, faster-than-light travel becomes possible only after the discovery of alien Ring Gates.", fact: true,
        explanation: "The bubble explains that early travel is limited to fusion propulsion and FTL only occurs after Ring Gates are discovered." },

      { text: "In Star Wars, the physics behind hyperspace travel is explained in detail in the films.", fact: false,
        explanation: "The Star Wars bubble states that the physics is deliberately vague and depends on a device called a hyperdrive." }
