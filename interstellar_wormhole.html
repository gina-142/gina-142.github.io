    <p style="font-size: 1.8em; text-align: left;"><strong>What is a Wormhole?</strong></p>
    
    <p>
      In general relativity, space and time form a four-dimensional geometry that can bend and stretch. A wormhole is a solution of Einstein’s field equations
      in which two distant regions of this geometry become directly connected by a curved pathway.
    </p>

    <p>
      If spacetime were imagined as a sheet, a wormhole would correspond to folding that sheet so that two distant points touch. The path through the fold is shorter
      than the path across the surface itself. Crucially, this does not involve travelling faster through space. Instead, it changes the structure of space itself,
      altering what “distance” means within the geometry.
    </p>

    <p>
      An Einstein–Rosen bridge<sup>3</sup> is a mathematical solution in which two regions of spacetime are connected by such a bridge. However, the original solution is not
      traversable: it would collapse too quickly for anything, even light, to pass through. A traversable wormhole is one that remains open long enough for matter or signals
      to pass safely. Morris and Thorne’s 1988 work<sup>4</sup> showed that this was mathematically possible under certain extreme physical conditions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Contrary to the name, a wormhole would not appear as a swirling tunnel in space. From the outside, it would appear as a perfectly smooth sphere. This is due to gravitational
      lensing: light from stars behind the wormhole bends around the curved spacetime surrounding it, wrapping the background universe around its surface<sup>6</sup>.

          The wormhole in <em>Interstellar</em> (2014). Its spherical appearance arises from gravitational lensing, as light from the background universe is bent around the curved spacetime surrounding the throat.

    <p>
      In the film, the visual effects team calculated this bending using relativistic ray tracing in curved spacetime<sup>1</sup>. The resulting simulations were so realistic that the work
      contributed to peer-reviewed research on visualising curved spacetime<sup>6</sup>.
