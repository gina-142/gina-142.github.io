<p>Projectile motion – specifically, attaining a safe acceleration- is the foundational physical limiting 
  factor for cannon-based manned space travel. </p>
<p>Before exploring Verne’s lunar cannon, we briefly examine the technical 
  principles of firing a cannon [1] , which broadly apply from medieval smoothbore guns 
  to the highly powered artillery of the American Civil War, the backdrop to <em>From the Earth to the Moon</em>.</p>
<p>1.	Loading the cannon </p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The cannon is, in effect, a hollow metal cylinder. The projectile – a cannonball or
  artillery shell – is placed into the barrel. A propellant is loaded behind it – into 
  the breech of the gun – to provide the energy and force for firing. Up until the 1880s, 
  black powder (a mixture of potassium nitrate, charcoal and sulfur in the ratio 75:15:10) 
  was commonly used. 
  In Verne’s Columbiad, fulminating cotton serves as the fictional explosive.</p>
<p>2.	Ignition</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The powder is ignited via a fuse or friction primer. 
  Rapid combustion produces expanding gases, generating high pressure behind
  the projectile. An electric spark is used to fire the Columbiad.</p>
<p>3.	Projectile acceleration</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The expanding gases push the projectile through the barrel. 
  Its acceleration is variable along the barrels length, governed by a
  variety of factors including the barrel’s dimensions, 
  the pressure of the gases, and, in turn, the propellant used.</p>

<p>4.	Ejection</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">
  Upon leaving the barrel, the projectile is no longer acted upon by the pressure of the 
  propellant’s gases. 
  It enters freefall, subject solely to gravity and air resistance.</p>
<p>5.	Recoil</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Newton’s third law dictates that as the projectile gains forward momentum, 
  the cannon itself gains backward momentum. Historically, this was managed by 
  the cannon carriage and crew – since the cannon has a very large mass, the velocity 
  it acquires is much smaller than that of the cannonball. In the case of Verne’s Columbiad,
  
  which is installed directly into the Earth, it triggers a dramatic earthquake:</p>


<div class="big-quote">
  <p>The discharge of the Columbiad was accompanied by a perfect earthquake. 
  Florida was shaken to its very depths. The gases of the powder, expanded 
  by heat, forced back the atmospheric strata with tremendous violence, and 
  this artificial
  hurricane rushed like a water-spout through the air.</p>

  <p>Not a single spectator remained on his feet! Men, women children, all 
  lay prostrate like ears of corn under a tempest. There ensued a terrible 
  tumult; a large number of persons were seriously injured. J. T. Maston, who, 
  despite all dictates of prudence, had kept in advance of the mass, was pitched 
  back 120 feet, shooting like a projectile over the heads of his fellow-citizens. 
  Three hundred thousand persons remained deaf for a time,
  and as though struck stupefied.</p>
</div>


<p>Verne’s cannon is a smoothbore – it lacks rifling. Rifling involves
  machining helical grooves inside the barrel, which impart spin to the 
  projectile and help maintain its stability in flight. Thus, Verne’s cannon
  is very straightforward in construction indeed. It is a hollow cylinder, 
  made of cast iron embedded deep into the ground.</p>

<p>Given that the projectile experiences variable acceleration both 
  inside the canon and in free flight (due to
  air resistance), constructing an exact mathematical model is extremely challenging [2].</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.8em; text-align: left;">
    <strong>Danger of high G</strong>
</p>

    
<p>Extensive research has been conducted into 
  the physiological effects of extreme accelerations on humans. g-force is a way of measuring acceleration relative to the acceleration due to gravity that we experience at the Earth's surface. 1G is simply the acceleration that an object (or an individual) experiences in free fall near the surface of the earth. It is approximately equal to 9.81 metres per second squared.</p>

<figure class="aacenter-image">

  <figcaption>^ Stoll's G-time curve<br>Source: Stoll, A. M. (1956). <em>Human tolerance to positive G as determined by the physiological end points.</em> U.S. Naval Aviation Medical Acceleration Laboratory, Johnsville, Pennsylvania, used under fair use for educational purposes</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Stoll's G-time curve demonstrates the dangers posed by sustained acceleration above approximately 3G.
  Humans can tolerate high g-forces, but only for very short durations [3].</p>
<p>This raises the central question:</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.8em; text-align: left;">
    <strong>What acceleration would a cannon impose?</strong>
</p>   

<p>Given that high g-forces are tolerable only briefly, it is reasonable to consider the
  <em>maximum acceleration</em> experienced by the projectile when assessing the 
  feasibility of manned cannon-based space travel.</p>
<p>To estimate this, we consider a highly idealised cannon. In this model, the projectile undergoes uniform 
  acceleration from rest to Earth's escape velocity.</p>
<p>Reaching escape velocity is essential: only at this velocity does the projectile possess sufficient kinetic
  energy to overcome the Earth's gravitational pull.</p>
<p>This is not a physically realistic cannon, per se. Gas expansion does not produce uniform acceleration for a given barrel length. However
  , this idealised case provides a <strong>lower bound</strong> on peak acceleration for a given barrel length. 
  Any real cannon would subject the projectile to even greater maximum accelerations.</p>
<p>It also neglects air resistance which would be a major mitigating factor. In the real world, where there is air resistance, a velocity of 11.2km/s is not sufficient to escape as some energy will be lost working against that resistance.</p>
<p>Using the SUVAT equation:</p>

<p> </p>
<p>\[
v^2 = u^2 + 2as
\]</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>\( v \) = escape velocity (11.2km/s)</li>
  <li>\( u \) = initial velocity (taken to be zero)</li>
  <li>\( a \) = acceleration inside the barrel</li>
  <li>\( s \) = barrel length</li>
</ul>
<p>Rearranging:</p>
<p></p>
<p>\[
a = \frac{v^2}{2s}
\]</p>



<p>Thus, the acceleration experienced in this idealised limiting case is proportional to the square of the escape velocity and inversely proportional to the cannon length.</p>
<p>If we want a low g-force, we need a long cannon... But just how long?</p>

<p>The graph below illustrates the relationship between g-force and cannon length. For clarity, 
accelerations above 10G are labelled "probably fatal," 3G-10G as "highly dangerous," and 1G-3G as "likely safe." Human 
tolerance depends on duration, physical condition and body orientation, so these boundaries are not definitive - examination of the 
Stoll curve above demonstrates that they are reasonable, though. Examination of established G-time data makes clear that sustained accelerations above 3G 
are physiologically hazardous, and the risk drops substantially after that cutoff.</p>
<p>For reference:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Maximum space shuttle acceleration during launch and re-entry: ~3G</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Apollo 16 peak re-entry acceleration: 7.19G</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Fighter pilot seat ejection: 15G-25G (for a very brief duration)</p>
    
<figure class="center-image">
  <img src="VernePhotos/cannongraph.png" alt="Description 1">
</figure>



<p>Using the idealised uniform acceleration model above, achieving a survivable acceleration of approximately 3G would require 
  a cannon over 2000km in length. For context, the Earth's average radius is 6371km. A human-rated cannon would therefore need to extend across a substantial fraction of the planet itself. 
  The required scale is not merely large - it's of the order of a thousand kilometres - it is geophysical.</p>


    
<p style="font-size: 1.8em; text-align: left;">
    <strong>Does Verne address the acceleration problem?</strong>
</p>   
<p>To his credit, Verne recognises that the launch impulse presents a fatal danger. He proposes a water-cushioning system within the projectile, intended to act as a spring and absorb the impulse [4]:</p>
<div class="big-quote">
  <p>The projectile had now to be filled to the depth of three feet with a bed of water, intended to support a water-tight wooden disc,
    which worked easily within the walls of the projectile. It was upon this kind of raft that the travelers were to take their place. 
    This body of water was divided by horizontal partitions, which the shock of the departure would have to break in succession. Then each 
    sheet of the water, from the lowest to the highest, running off into escape tubes toward the top of the projectile, constituted a kind 
    of spring; and the wooden disc, supplied with extremely powerful plugs, could not strike the lowest plate except after breaking successively
    the different partitions. Undoubtedly the travelers would still have to encounter a violent recoil after the complete escapement of the water;
    but the first shock would be almost entirely destroyed by this powerful spring. The upper parts of the walls were lined with a thick padding of
    leather, fastened upon springs of the best steel, behind which the escape tubes were completely concealed; thus all imaginable precautions had
    been taken for averting the first shock; and if they did get crushed, they must, as Michel Ardan said, be made of very bad materials.</p>
</div> 

<p>This is an imaginative attempt at sci-fi realism; Verne is indeed wise to address this issue.
  However, the fundamental issue remains unchained. The acceleration experienced by the travellers depends primarily on the distance over which they are brought up to escape velocity. 
The Columbiad is only 900 feet long. No internal cushioning can meaningfully reduce peak acceleration without dramatically increasing the distance over which deceleration occurs. 
To achieve survivable conditions the cushioning itself would need to extend over hundreds - or indeed thousands - of kilometres.</p>
<p>The constraint is therefore geometric, rather than solely mechanical.</p>


<p style="font-size: 1.8em; text-align: left;">
    <strong>Columbiad: The Verdict</strong>
</p> 

<p>Under the most generous possible assumptions - uniform acceleration, ideal energy transfer and no air resistance - Verne's passengers 
  would experience a minimum acceleration ~20,000G. This would be instantly fatal, and exceed anything ever experienced and survived by a human.</p> 

<p>Verne demonstrates impressive technical imagination. Yet he is ultimately constrained by human physiology and biological frailty. If the powder is actually sufficient to reach escape velocity 
  - and that is a problem for the chemist - The Columbiad may be able to launch an invincible projectile to the moon. It cannot launch a person.</p>
