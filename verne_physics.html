    <strong>The Columbiad</strong>

<p>Projectile motion – specifically, attaining a safe acceleration- is the foundational physical limiting 
  factor for cannon-based manned space travel. </p>
<p>Before exploring Verne’s lunar cannon, we briefly examine the technical 
  principles of firing a cannon [1] , which broadly apply from medieval smoothbore guns 
  to the highly powered artillery of the American Civil War, the backdrop to From the Earth to the Moon.</p>
<p>1.	Loading the cannon </p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The cannon is, in effect, a hollow metal cylinder. The projectile – a cannonball or
  artillery shell – is placed into the barrel. A propellant is loaded behind it – into 
  the breech of the gun – to provide the energy and force for firing. Up until the 1880s, 
  black powder (a mixture of potassium nitrate, charcoal and sulfur in the ratio 75:15:10) 
  was commonly used. 
  In Verne’s Columbiad, fulminating cotton serves as the fictional explosive.</p>
<p>2.	Ignition</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The powder is ignited via a fuse or friction primer. 
  Rapid combustion produces expanded gases, generating high pressure behind
  the projectile. An electric spark is used to fire the Columbiad.</p>
<p>3.	Projectile acceleration</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The expanding gases push the projectile through the barrel. 
  It’s acceleration is variable along the barrels length, governed by a
  variety of factors including the barrel’s dimensions, 
  the pressure of the gases, and, in turn, the propellant used.</p>

<p>4.	Ejection</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">
  Upon leaving the barrel, the projectile is no longer acted upon by the pressure of the 
  propellant’s gases. 
  It enters freefall, subject solely to gravity and air resistance.</p>
<p>5.	Recoil</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Newton’s third law dictates that as the projectile gains forward momentum, 
  the cannon itself gains backward momentum. Historically, this was managed by 
  the cannon carriage and crew – since the cannon has a very large mass, the velocity 
  it acquires is much smaller than that of the cannonball. In the case of Verne’s Columbiad,
  
  which is installed directly into the Earth, it triggers a dramatic Earthquake.</p>


<div class="big-quote">
  <p>The discharge of the Columbiad was accompanied by a perfect earthquake. 
  Florida was shaken to its very depths. The gases of the powder, expanded 
  by heat, forced back the atmospheric strata with tremendous violence, and 
  this artificial
  hurricane rushed like a water-spout through the air.</p>

  <p>Not a single spectator remained on his feet! Men, women children, all 
  lay prostrate like ears of corn under a tempest. There ensued a terrible 
  tumult; a large number of persons were seriously injured. J. T. Maston, who, 
  despite all dictates of prudence, had kept in advance of the mass, was pitched 
  back 120 feet, shooting like a projectile over the heads of his fellow-citizens. 
  Three hundred thousand persons remained deaf for a time,
  and as though struck stupefied.</p>

<p>Verne’s cannon is a smoothbore – it lacks rifling. Rifling involves
  machining helical grooves inside the barrel, which impart spin to the 
  projectile and help maintain its stability in flight. Thus, Verne’s cannon
  is very straightforward in construction indeed. It is a hollow cylinder, 
  made of caste iron embedded deep into the ground.</p>

<p>Given that the projectile experiences variable acceleration both 
  inside the canon and in free flight (due in part to
  air resistance), constructing an exact mathematical model is extremely challenging [2]</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.8em; text-align: left;">
    <strong>Danger of high G</strong>
</p>

<p>Extensive research has been conducted into 
  the physiological effects of extreme accelerations on humans.</p>

<figure class="aacenter-image">
  <img src="VernePhotos/Ggraph.png" alt="Description 1">  
</figure>
<p>Stoll's G-time curve demonstrates the dangers posed by sustained acceleration above approximately 3G.
  Humans can tolerate high G-forces, but only for very short durations.</p>
<p>This raises the central question:</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.8em; text-align: left;">
    <strong>What acceleration would a cannon impose?</strong>
</p>   

<p>Given that high G-forces are tolerable only briefly, it is reasonable to consider the
  <em>maximum acceleration</em> experienced by the projectile when assessing the 
  feasibility of manned cannon-based space travel.</p>
<p>To estimate this, we consider a highly idealised cannon. In this model, the projectile undergoes uniform 
  acceleration from rest to Earth's escape velocity.</p>
<p>Reaching escape velocity is essential: only at this velocity does the projectile possess sufficient kinetic
  energy to overcome the Earth's gravitational pull.</p>
<p>This is not a physically realistic cannon, per se. Gas expansion does not produce uniform acceleration for a given barrel length. However
  , this idealised case provides a <strong>lower bound</strong> on peak acceleration for a given barrel length. 
  Any real cannon would subject the projectile to even greater maximum accelerations.</p>
<p>Using the SUVAT equation:</p>

<p> </p>
<p>\[
v^2 = u^2 + 2as
\]</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>v = escape velocity</li>
  <li>u = initial velocity (taken to be zero)</li>
  <li>a = acceleration inside the barrel</li>
  <li>s = barrel length</li>
</ul>
<p>Rearranging:</p>
<p></p>
<p>\[
a = v^2/2s
\]</p>
<p>Thus, the acceleration experienced in this idealised limiting case is proportional to the square of the escape velocity and inversely proportional to the cannon length.</p>
<p>If we want low Gs, we need a long cannon... But just how long?</p>
