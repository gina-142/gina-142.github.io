    <strong>Newton's Cannon</strong>
</p>
<div class="big-quote">
    But if we now imagine bodies to be projected in the directions of lines parallel 
  to the horizon from greater heights, as of 5, 10, 100, 1000 or more miles, or rather
  as many semi-diameters of the Earth; those bodies, according to their different velocity, 
  and the different force of gravity in different heights, will describe arcs either 
  concentric with the Earth, or variously excentric, and go on revolving through the heavens
  in those trajectories just as the Planets do in their orbs.
  </div>

    
<p>Newton, in his <em>Principia Mathematica</em> is often cited to be the first person to propose space travel with a cannon. 
  He notes that if one launches a projectile from a mountain with sufficient velocity, it will enter into orbit, just like the planets [1]. If a projectile is launched horizontally with a sufficient velocity, the curvature of the Earth causes the Earth to 'fall' underneath it. It thus falls continuously, entering orbit.</p>

    <strong>Verne's historical context</strong>
</p>

<p>Jules Verne was born on the 8th of February 1828 and died on the 24th of March 1905. Living in the 19th Century,
  he experienced the peak of the industrial revolution, and his work is characterised by the cultural 
  logic of that period. Namely, mass mobilisation.</p>
<p>Political philosopher Charles Taylor describes this period as "The Age of Mobilisation", defining mobilisation to be "the process by which people are 
  persuaded, pushed, dragooned or bullied 
  into new forms of society, church and society... induced through new forms of society, church and association not only to 
  adopt new structures but also to some extent to alter their social imaginaries". Whilst mobilisation occured in the past, 
  such as in the Crusades, that occured against the backdrop of something else. Within this period, mobilisation was the context itself [2].</p>
<p>Verne's novels portray this mobilisation as rallying people, resources and labour to pursue a collosal endeavour - as exemplified by the manufacturing
 of the Columbiad in <em>From the Earth to the Moon</em>. In doing so, he expands the scope of the human imagination.</p>
<p>His vision is not simply fantastical - it constitutes an extrapolation of the current understanding. Adam Roberts notes:</p>
<div class="big-quote">
    Verne's great appeal for readers had to do with the dream he sold of mobility, imaginatively extrapolated from the present into a near-future where 
  restrictions and incapacities could be removed and new things became possible.
  </div>

<p>Verne's works may have been imaginative, but his works are not wholly freewheeling. His second submission to his publisher Pierre-Jules Hetzel, <em>Paris in the 20th Century</em>, 
  was rejected, Hetzel telling Verne that "you have taken on an impossible task" [2]. Realism was therefore at the back of Verne's mind, as getting published depended on it. This may explain why 
  his astronauts never actually make it to the moon. He had no mechanism with which to land safely, nor to return. It furthermore, prevents him from inaccurately depicting what the lunar world is like.
  In his sequel, the Gun Club astronauts embark on a mission, <em>Around the Moon</em>.</p>

  <figcaption>^ Columbus landing. Verne's depiction of space travel is part of a wider human narrative of boundary-pushing</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>From the Earth to the moon dedicates little content to the nature of the moon itself
  besides a heated debate between Michel Ardan and Captain Nicholl about how Ardan plans to survive on the lunar surface. 
The main focus of the book is the gung-ho ethos of the Baltimore Gun Club and their imperialist ambitions, as exemplified by Barbicane's explicit 
intent of conquest when proposing the mission:</p>

<div class="big-quote">
  There is no one among you, my brave colleagues, who has not seen the Moon, or, at least, heard speak of it. Don’t be surprised if I am about 
    to discourse to you regarding the Queen of the Night. It is perhaps reserved for us to become the Columbuses of this unknown world.
    Only enter into my plans, and second me with all your power, and I will lead you to its conquest, and its name shall be added to those of the 
    thirty-six states which compose this Great Union.
</div>  

<p>Adam Roberts, wisely notes that "the emblem of the novel is the enormous gun, bigger and more powerful than anything made before".</p>
<p>We retrospectively assess the factity and realism in light of the fact that there were things that Verne got "right". The Apollo missions 
did launch from Florida, for example. But Verne's intentions, whilst placing emphasis on the science, were not to produce a work of hard 
scientific realism.</p>

<p>Such conquistadorial vibes are reflected in the name of the cannon. The Columbiad wass the name of a contemporary cannon, but it also pays homage to 
  Christopher Columbus and the wider Age of Discovery.</p>
<p>In fact, the understanding of how much acceleration a human could sustain was much more conservative than it is today. That is, Verne would 
  have thought that the Gs experienced by the passengers of the Columbiad's projectile were even more dangerous than we now know they would have been today. As 
  is noted by Adam Roberts, "we may wish to infer that, until the sequel was written [five years later], the astronauts were in 
  fact slain by the unforseen effects of acceleration." This accounts for the darker undertones of the final pages of the book. Only J.T. Maston, the frenetic Gun Club secretary, remains optimistic [2].</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.8em; text-align: left;">
    <strong>Pushing beyond the Final Frontier?</strong>
</p> 
<p>Jules Verne's book reflects wider ambitions to explore beyond the Earth. Whilst the South Pole had not yet been reached (Roald
  Amundsen would travel there in 1911), most of the world had been charted.</p>
<p>The poet Walt Whitman in his 1860 poem, <em>Facing West from California's Shores</em>, reflects on the globe having largely been charted:</p>
<div class="big-quote">
 FACING west, from California's shores,<br>
Inquiring, tireless, seeking what is yet unfound,<br>
I, a child, very old, over waves, towards the house of maternity, the<br>
        land of migrations, look afar,<br>
Look off the shores of my Western Sea—the circle almost circled;<br>
For, starting westward from Hindustan, from the vales of Kashmere,<br>
From Asia—from the north—from the God, the sage, and the hero,<br>
From the south—from the flowery peninsulas, and the spice islands;<br>
Long having wander'd since—round the earth having wander'd,<br>
Now I face home again—very pleas'd and joyous;<br>
(But where is what I started for, so long ago?  <br>                  


And why is it yet unfound?)
</div>
<p>This alludes to the sense that exploration on Earth is mostly complete. Verne's technological quest, is inherently bound up in Whitman's existential quest 
  ("But where is what I started for so long ago? And why is it yet unfound?). Verne's Columbiad, though imaginary, sates the desire for an expansion of 
  human boundaries and an "unfound" exploratory pursuit. In his later 1871 work, <em>Passage to India</em>, he dreams of venturing forth 
  beyond the terrestrial sphere.</p>

<div class="big-quote">
  Passage to more than India!<br> 
Are thy wings plumed indeed for such far flights?<br> 
O soul, voyagest thou indeed on voyages like those?<br> 
Disportest thou on waters such as those?<br> 
Soundest below the Sanscrit and the Vedas?<br> 
Then have thy bent unleash'd.<br> 
Passage to you, your shores, ye aged fierce enigmas!<br> 
Passage to you, to mastership of you, ye strangling problems!<br> 
You, strew'd with the wrecks of skeletons, that, living, never <br>  
 reach'd you.<br> 
Passage to more than India!<br> 
O secret of the earth and sky!<br> 
Of you O waters of the sea! O winding creeks and rivers!<br> 
Of you O woods and fields! of you strong mountains of my land!<br> 
Of you O prairies! of you gray rocks!<br> 
O morning red! O clouds! O rain and snows!<br> 
O day and night, passage to you!<br> 
O sun and moon and all you stars! Sirius and Jupiter!<br> 
Passage to you!<br> 
Passage, immediate passage! the blood burns in my veins!<br> 
Away O soul! hoist instantly the anchor!
</div>
<p>His passage extends beyond the oceans, all the way to Sirius and Jupiter. Verne is, in essence, depicting a fulfilment of humanity's 
  spacefaring ambitions. Both Whitman and Verne respond to a cultural milieu in which terrestrial discoverey seemed nearly complete and the imagined frontier had become outer space.</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.8em; text-align: left;">
    <strong>To cannon or not to cannon?</strong>
</p> 
<p>As mentioned before, during the Victorian period, people were well-aware of the dangers of acceleration - so much so, in fact, that there were concerns that a steam train could cause serious bodily harm. Thus, the Columbiad 
was actually an unusual choice of launch system. As spaceflight-oriented science fiction emerged, people tended to focus on anti-gravity methods of travel.</p>
<p>George Tucker employs one of the earliest known examples of an anti-gravity device in his novel <em>A Voyage to the Moon</em>. In it, 
a material called 'Lunarium' which is both repelled by the Earth and attracted to the moon, is used to take his protagonist to the moon [3]. Percy Greg in 
  <em>Across the Zodiac: the Story of a Wrecked Record</em>, describes the discovery of "apergy", anti-gravity energy which is used to take people to Mars in a 
  ship known as 'the astronaut'. It is the first known use of the term [4].</p>
<figure class="aacenter-image">
  <img src="VernePhotos/FirstMenMoon.jpg" alt="Description 1">

</figure>

<p>Most notably, however, is the substance Cavorite, employed by H.G. Wells, in his work, <em>The First Men in the Moon</em>. In this book, Mr. Cavor produces 
a substance that is "opaque to gravity" [5]. Applying it to a spacecraft allows him to travel to the moon where he meets the Selenites.</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.8em; text-align: left;">
    <strong>Command Module Columbia</strong>
</p> 
<figure class="aacenter-image">
  <img src="VernePhotos/Columbiamodule.jpg" alt="Description 1">
  <figcaption>^ The Command Module Columbia on display in the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington DC</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Bringing it all back to the modern (ish) period, the Command Module Columbia, used during the Apollo 11 mission, was explicitly named in honour of Jules Verne's Columbiad. 
Julian Scheer, NASAs assistant administrator mentioned to Michael Collins in passing "some of us up here have been kicking around Columbia." Michael Collins, the Command Module Pilot - with initial reservations - opted for the name Columbia. He chose it, in part to pay homage to Verne's Columbiad.</p>

<p>Thus, Verne's work <em>From the Earth to the Moon</em>, is historically significant in that it denotes the era's ethos of pushing boundaries. 
It reflects the long human tradition of human boundary pushing, and although it may be fiction, echoes of the Columbiad are seen in the modern period. 
They are seen, both in Apollo 11, which took place just over 100 miles from Verne's launch site, and in modern efforts to use space guns, which we will explore in a later section.</p>

<p>Next, we will have a think about the physics of the Columbiad itself.</p>
