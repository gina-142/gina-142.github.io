    <strong>Newton's Cannon</strong>
</p>
<div class="big-quote">
    But if we now imagine bodies to be projected in the directions of lines parallel 
  to the horizon from greater heights, as of 5, 10, 100, 1000 or more miles, or rather
  as many semi-diameters of the Earth; those bodies, according to their different velocity, 
  and the different force of gravity in different heights, will describe arcs either 
  concentric with the Earth, or variously excentric, and go on revolving through the heavens
  in those trajectories just as the Planets do in their orbs.
  </div>

    
<p>Newton, in his <em>Principia Mathematica</em> is often cited to be the first person to propose space travel with a cannon. 
  He notes that if one launches a projectile from a mountain with sufficient velocity, it will enter into orbit, just like the planets [1]. If a projectile is launched horizontally with a sufficient velocity, the curvature of the Earth causes the Earth to 'fall' underneath it. It thus falls continuously, entering orbit.</p>

    <strong>Verne's historical context</strong>
</p>

<p>Jules Verne was born on the 8 February 1828 and died on 24 March 1905. Living in the 19th Century,
  he experienced the peak of the industrial revolution, and his work is characterised by the cultural 
  logic of that period: namely, mass mobilisation.</p>
<p>Political philosopher Charles Taylor describes this period as "The Age of Mobilisation", defining mobilisation to be "the process by which people are 
  persuaded, pushed, dragooned or bullied 
  into new forms of society, church and society, induced through new forms of society, church and association not only to 
  adopt new structures but also to some extent to alter their social imaginaries". Whilst mobilisation occured in the past, 
  such as in the Crusades, that occured against the backdrop of something else. Within this period, mobilisation was the context itself [2].</p>
<p>Verne's novels portray this mobilisation as rallying people, resources and labour to pursue a collosal endeavour - as exemplified by the manufacturing
 of the Columbiad in <em>From the Earth to the Moon</em>. In doing so, he expands the scope of the human imagination.</p>
<p>His vision is not simply fantastical - it constitutes an extrapolation of the current understanding. Adam Roberts notes:</p>
<div class="big-quote">
    Verne's great appeal for readers had to do with the dream he sold of mobility, imaginatively extrapolated from the present into a near-future where 
  restrictions and incapacities could be removed and new things became possible.
  </div>

<p>Verne's works may have been imaginateive, but his works are not wholly freewheeling. His second submission to his publisher Hetzel, <em>Paris in the 20th Century</em>, 
  was rejected, Hetzel telling Verne that "you have taken on an impossible task" [2]. Realism was thus demonstrably at the back of Verne's mind. This may indicate why he didn't 
  actually land his astronauts on the moon. He had no mechanism which which to do so safely, nor to return. They simply embark on a mission around the moon.</p>

<p>From the Earth to the moon dedicates little content to the nature of the moon itself,
  besides a heated debate between Michel Ardan and Captain Nicholl about how Ardan plans to survive on the lunar surface. 
The main focus of the book is the gung-ho ethos of the Baltimore Gun Club and their imperialist ambitions, as exemplified by Barbicane's explicit 
intent of conquest when proposing the mission:</p>

<div class="big-quote">
  There is no one among you, my brave colleagues, who has not seen the Moon, or, at least, heard speak of it. Don’t be surprised if I am about 
    to discourse to you regarding the Queen of the Night. It is perhaps reserved for us to become the Columbuses of this unknown world.
    Only enter into my plans, and second me with all your power, and I will lead you to its conquest, and its name shall be added to those of the 
    thirty-six states which compose this Great Union.
</div>  

<p>Adam Roberts, wisely notes that "the emblem of the novel is the enormous gun, bigger and more powerful than anything made before".</p>
<p>We retrospectively assess the factity and realism in light of the fact that there were things that Verne got "right". The Apollo missions 
did launch from Florida, for example. But Verne's intentions, whilst placing emphasis on the science, were not to produce a work of hard 
scientific realism.</p>
<p>In fact, the understanding of how much acceleration a human could sustain were much more conservative today. That is, Verne would have thought that the Gs experienced by the passengers of the Columbiad's projectile were even more dangerous than believed today. As is noted by Adam Roberts, "we may wish to infer that, until the sequel was written [published five years later], the astronauts were in fact slain by the unforseen effects of acceleration." This accounts for the darker undertones of the final pages of the book. Only JT Maston remains optimistic [2].</p>
