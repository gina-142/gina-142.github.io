      <strong>The Warp Drive</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      Have you ever wondered how far it would be possible to travel in our universe? Or how fast you could travel? This has been a problem 
      of much of modern science fiction. If we have already discovered and explored everything within the reachable universe, how would our 
      characters meet new challenges?
    </p>

    <p>
      In Star Trek, huge ships, like the Star ship Enterprise, are able to ‘warp’ to speeds much faster
      than the speed of light. When the universe is so big, travelling even close to the speed of light
      would not get you very far, so like much of science fiction, they came up with a way of bypassing
      this limit on scale and speed.

    <p>
      The ‘warp drive’ is a form of interstellar propulsion, first introduced 
      in the 1957 novel ‘Islands of Space’ written by John W. Campbell<sup>1</sup>, but most remember it from its popularisation 
      in Star Trek, beginning in 1966. It is described in Star Trek as generating a ‘warp bubble’ around the ship, 
      from a high energy source, which distorts space-time. It can be thought of as squashing space time together, 
      meaning the ship does not have to physically travel as far and not break the universal speed limit, but to an 
      outside observer, the ship appears to have travelled incredibly fast across a huge distance. It is roughly analogous 
      to how worm holes allow travel across the universe by bending space-time (see the Interstellar case study).

      <strong>Star Wars</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      Star Wars, one of the dominant science fiction universes, alongside Star Trek, also tries to combat this problem of the speed of light limit, but instead uses 'hyperspace drives'<sup>2</sup>. Unlike in Star Trek, the ships don't actually travel though our universe. The drive sends the ship into 'hyperspace', an alternate space-time dimension. In this alternate universe, the laws of physics as we know them don't exist and ships are able to exceed the speed of light. 
    </p>

    <p>
      While Star Wars knew that they could't have superluminal travel in our own universe, even when stretching physics to its breaking point, this hyperspace drive has no grounding in reality and is even less probable than a warp drive in our reality.

      <strong>Battlestar Gallactica</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      Both Star Trek and Star Wars try and allow for far interstellar travel by beating the universal speed limit. Battlestar Gallactica (1978) instead takes the approach of asking: what if we didn't need to travel in a finite amount of time, what if we could travel instantly across space?<sup>3</sup> The Jump Drive, is more of a teleportation device than an engine, and allows the ships to travel instantly to almost anywhere in space. Of course, Battlestar Gallactica wasn't the only science fiction universe to use teleportation. Star Trek freqently uses transporters to move personnel from the ship to planets and back again ('Beam me up, Scotty'). In both uses, they stress the importance of the complex calculations involved, as to not appear inside a planet when rematerialising.

    <p>
      While teleportation may seem the most far fetched idea so far, it does have some basis in real physics, although we will likely not have transporters any time in the near future. As you will see with Star Trek's warp drives on the next page, the physics here is contrained to very small scales, in the quantum world and currently cannot be applied to the cosmological scales needed for space travel. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Quantum physics introduces many, seemingly impossible, ideas. In 1966, science fiction and fantasy author Ursula K. Le Guin coined the term 'ansible', which is used by many science fiction authors to describe a device for interstellar communication. This technology is rooted in ideas of quantum entanglement, where two particles regardless of their physical loaction, cannot be described independently of each other. In other words, they are linked, or entangled. For communication, this could be theoretically used to transmit information, as the data could be transcribed onto one particle, which then appears on the entangled particle, possibly at the other end of the universe.<sup>4</sup> Theoretically, you could write all the information needed to 'rebuild' the person or object at the other end to teleport them to a new location.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, currently quantum entanglement is currently just something we are able to observe, so we are a long way off rebuilding our own data, read off entangled quantum particles.
