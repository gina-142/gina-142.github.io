    <strong>The Plot</strong>
  </p>
  <div class="big-quote">
    “The estimation in which these gentlemen were held, according to one of the most scientific exponents of the Gun Club,
    was “proportional to the masses of their guns, and in the direct ratio of the square of the distances attained by their projectiles.”
  </div>

  <p>
    Jules Verne’s 1865 novel <em>From the Earth to the Moon: A Direct Route in 97 Hours, 20 Minutes</em> tells the story of the Baltimore Gun Club
    – an association of engineers and artillery enthusiasts united by their unparalleled obsession with weaponry. With the American Civil War 
    over and no cannons left to fire, the members grow restless; deprived of conflict, “they gave themselves up wholly to dreams of a
    Platonic kind of artillery”.

    <strong>The Plan</strong>
  </p>
  <p>At the behest of the Club’s President, Impey Barbicane, a meeting is convened. He announces:</p>  



  <div class="big-quote">
    “Moreover, you are well aware that, in general terms, the resisting power of cannon and the expansive force
    of gunpowder are practically unlimited. </div>
  <div class="big-quote">I have looked at the question in all its bearings, I have resolutely attacked it, and by incontrovertible calculations 
    I find that a projectile endowed with an initial velocity of 12,000 yards per second, and aimed at the moon, must necessarily reach it.
    I have the honor, my brave colleagues, to propose a trial of this little experiment."
  </div>

  <p>
    The proposal is simple in spirit and absurd in scale: build a cannon large enough – and powerful enough – to strike the moon.</p>
<p>What follows is a tale of unrestrained masculinity and industrial ambition. The physics is deeply flawed, but the technical imagination is staggering. 
    This is a moon mission conceived in a pre-car era; Gun Club members ride on horseback while discussing escape velocities.</p>
<p>It is important to note: This is not initially a manned mission. The aim has nothing to do with exploration. It is ballistics.</p>
<p>The Observatory at Cambridge, Massachusetts, provides the necessary calculations: 

  </p>
<div class="big-quote">
  “1st. The cannon ought to be planted in a country situated between 0° and 28° of N. or S. lat.
</div>
<div class="big-quote">
2nd. It ought to be pointed directly toward the zenith of the place.
</div>
<div class="big-quote">
3rd. The projectile ought to be propelled with an initial velocity of 12,000 yards per second.
</div>
<div class="big-quote">
4th. It ought to be discharged at 10hrs. 46m. 40sec. of the 1st of December of the ensuing year.
</div>
<div class="big-quote">
5th. It will meet the moon four days after its discharge, precisely at midnight on the 4th of December, at the moment of its transit across the zenith.”

</div>

<p>
  They have just over a year to prepare. Miss the window, and the next viable opportunity will not occur for eighteen years.</p> 
<p>A projectile 108 inches in diameter is selected – large enough to be observed from Earth. What remains is engineering and the
  question of technical capacity.

</p>

<div class="big-quote">
  
</div>
<p>
  
</p>
    
<div class="big-quote">
  “The problem before us is how to communicate an initial force of 12,000 yards per second to a shell of 108 inches in diameter, 
  weighing 20,000 pounds”   
</div>

    
<p>
  Barbicane settles – through a mixture of calculation, hard science, and dubious heuristic – on a 900-foot cannon, 
  charged with 400,000 pounds of fulminating cotton.</p>
<p>After a brief but violent dispute between the Texans and the Floridians over who could host the cannon, Tampa is chosen as the launch site.</p>

    <strong>Casting the Cannon</strong>
  </p>
<p>Verne devotes extraordinary attention to the casting of the cannon. He turns metallurgy into a literary spectacle. And indeed, 
  in this period, such scale would have been unprecedented.

</p>

<div class="big-quote">
  “During the eight months which were employed in the work of excavation the preparatory works of the casting
  had been carried on simultaneously with extreme rapidity. A stranger arriving at Stones Hill would have been
  surprised at the spectacle offered to his view.
At 600 yards from the well, and circularly arranged around it as a central point, rose 1,200 reverberating ovens, 
  each six feet in diameter, and separated from each other by an interval of three feet. The circumference occupied 
  by these 1,200 ovens presented a length of two miles. Being all constructed on the same plan, each with its high quadrangular chimney,
  they produced a most singular effect.
It will be remembered that on their third meeting the committee had decided to use cast iron for the Columbiad, and in particular 
  the white description. This metal, in fact, is the most tenacious, the most ductile, and the most malleable, and consequently suitable for
  all moulding operations; and when smelted with pit coal, is of superior quality for all engineering works requiring great resisting power, 
  such as cannon, steam boilers, hydraulic presses, and the like.
Cast iron, however, if subjected to only one single fusion, is rarely sufficiently homogeneous; and it requires a second fusion completely to 
  refine it by dispossessing it of its last earthly deposits. So long before being forwarded to Tampa Town, the iron ore, molten in the great 
  furnaces of Coldspring, and brought into contact with coal and silicium heated to a high temperature, was carburized and transformed into cast 
  iron. After this first operation, the metal was sent on to Stones Hill. They had, however, to deal with 136,000,000 pounds of iron, a quantity 
  far too costly to send by railway. The cost of transport would have been double that of material. It appeared preferable to freight vessels 
  at New York, and to load them with the iron in bars. This, however, required not less than sixty- eight vessels of 1,000 tons, a veritable 
  fleet, which, quitting New York on the 3rd of May, on the 10th of the same month ascended the Bay of Espiritu Santo, and discharged their 
  cargoes, without dues, in the port at Tampa Town. Thence the iron was transported by rail to Stones Hill, and about the middle of January
  this enormous mass of metal was delivered at its destination.
It will easily be understood that 1,200 furnaces were not too many to melt simultaneously these 60,000 tons of iron. Each of these furnaces 
  contained nearly 140,000 pounds weight of metal. They were all built after the model of those which served for the casting of the Rodman gun; 
  they were trapezoidal in shape, with a high elliptical arch. These furnaces, constructed of fireproof brick, were especially adapted for 
  burning pit coal, with a flat bottom upon which the iron bars were laid. This bottom, inclined at an angle of 25 degrees, allowed the metal 
  to flow into the receiving troughs; and the 1,200 converging trenches carried the molten metal down to the central well.”

</div>
<p>
  The completed cannon is christened the Columbiad – both an homage to an earlier cannon, and to Columbus himself.
  It is symbolic of mankind’s capacity to push boundaries.</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.8em; text-align: left;">
    <strong>Michel Ardan</strong>
  </p>    
<p>Just as the construction concludes, a telegram arrives:

</p>    

<div class="big-quote">
  “FRANCE, PARIS,
</div>
<div class="big-quote">
  30 September, 4 A.M
</div>
<div class="big-quote">
  Barbicane, Tampa Town, Florida, United States.
</div>
<div class="big-quote">
  Substitute for your spherical shell a cylindro-conical projectile. I shall go inside. Shall arrive by steamer Atlanta.
</div>
<div class="big-quote">
  MICHEL ARDAN”
</div>

<p>
  With that, the focus then shifts from mere projectile to spacecraft.</p>
<p>Michel Ardan – flamboyant, idealistic and utterly fearless – proposes to travel inside the shell. Public excitement erupts.
  One dissenter challenges the feasibility of the mission and demands to know how Ardan intends to return. He calmly replies 
  that he does not intend to do so.</p>

</figure>

<p style="font-size: 1.8em; text-align: left;">
    <strong>Rivalry</strong>
  </p>    
<p>The opponent is revealed to be Captain Nicholl, long-time rival of Barbicane – an armour specialist who has spent his career 
  designing shields to counter the Gun Club’s artillery. He is the sole American opponent to the Gun Club’s lunar ambitions. 
  Their professional antagonism escalates to the challenge of a duel. Riding at dawn, only the intervention of Michel Ardan and 
  J.T. Maston, the Gun Club’s secretary, prevent disaster.</p>
<p>In a final gesture of reconciliation, Ardan invites these mortal enemies to join him inside the capsule.</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.8em; text-align: left;">
    <strong>Launch</strong>
  </p>
<p>The Columbiad is loaded. The clock strikes 10hrs. 46m. 40sec on the 1st of December. The Columbiad fires!</p>
<p>Due to a storm, astronomers on Earth are unable to monitor the mission. After a week shrouded in the unknown, astronomers finally
  discover that the astronauts have missed the moon.</p>
<p>Instead, captured by lunar gravity, the travellers are carried into orbit – setting the stage for Verne’s sequel, <em>Around the Moon</em>.
