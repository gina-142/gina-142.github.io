    <strong>Physical Primers</strong>
  </p>
<p>So - you want to escape Earth and fly into space.</p>
<p>Before we can venture into the deep black, we need a little physics. What follows are 
  three conceptual primers underpinning both real-world rocketry and its depiction in 
  science fiction:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;">
- Escape velocity
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">
- The rocket equation
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">
- Time dilation
</p>
<p>The first two govern real spaceflight. The latter applies only to speculative fiction 
- it is relevant only when velocities approach the speed of light.</p>
<p>In all cases, we consider highly idealised systems. We are interested in physical 
plausibility, not technical feasibility. The latter is what makes spaceflight so difficult; 
science fiction is often content to bypass this.</p>
<p>Gravity imposes an energy cost on spaceflight. Momentum imposes exponential scaling and a technical faff. 
  Physica and the fabric of spacetime resist narrative desires.</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.8em; text-align: left;">
    <strong>Escape velocity: Escaping the gravitational well</strong>
</p>

<p>To venture forth into the final frontier, a spacecraft must reach what is known as an 
  escape velocity – the minimum speed required to avoid falling back down to Earth under 
  gravity.</p>
<p>In principle, this is fairly straightforward – simple Newtonian physics, basic algebraic manipulation and 
  easy to intuit. In practice, it is one of the greatest engineering challenges humanity has ever faced – and 
  conquered.</p>
<p>The fact that it took until 1957 until the first man-made objects to achieve escape velocity – two small 
  pellet sized probes – is testament to the tight grip of these technical constraints. 
  Orbiting is difficult – escaping is much harder still.</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.8em; text-align: left;">
    <strong>Energy: The cosmic accounting system</strong>
</p>

<p>We will need to consider the two forms of energy that determine whether we break free 
  from the terrestrial chains: <em>Kinetic energy</em> (K.E) and <em>gravitational potential 
    energy</em> (G.P.E).</p>

<p>It does not matter how you conceptualise these two quantities – the numbers and the maths 
  are what count here!</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.8em; text-align: left;">
    <strong>Kinetic energy (K.E.)</strong>
</p> 
<p>An object in motion possesses kinetic energy:</p>
<p>\[
K.E. = \frac{1}{2} m v^2
\]</p>

<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>\( m \) = object's mass</li>
  <li>\( v \) = object velocity</li>
</ul>
<p>In our case, \( v \) is the upward speed of the spacecraft.</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.8em; text-align: left;">
    <strong>Gravitational Potential Energy (G.P.E.).</strong>
  </p>  

<p>An object possesses gravitational potential energy by virtue of its position in 
  a gravitational field, produced by the Earth. It is equivalent to the energy you would
  need to expend to separate the object and Earth to infinity. It is given by:</p>

<p>\[
G.P.E. = - \frac{GMm}{r}
\]</p>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>\( M \) = Earth's mass</li>
  <li>\( m \) = object mass</li>
  <li>\( r \) = distance of the object from the Earth's (or applicable planet's) centre</li>
  <li>\( G \) = the gravitational constant – a universal value that governs 
    the strength of gravity across the cosmos </li>
</ul>   
<p>The negative sign matters here. We define gravitational potential energy to 
  be zero at infinite distance. At the Earth’s surface, it is negative – meaning
  energy must be supplied to escape.</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.8em; text-align: left;">
    <strong>Conservation of energy</strong>
</p>

<p>Abstracting further, energy is simply a number that remains constant. For our 
  spacecraft, its total energy is simply the sum of its gravitational potential 
  energy and its kinetic energy:</p>
<p>\[
Total Energy = K.E. + G.P.E. = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 - \frac{GMm}{r}
\]</p>
<p>As the spacecraft rises:</p>


<ul>
  <li>Its gravitational potential energy increases – thus becoming less negative.</li>
  <li>Its kinetic energy decreases to balance this.</li>
</ul> 

<p>You may think transactionally: Kinetic energy is “spent” climbing out of Earth’s 
  gravitational well and converted to potential energy.</p>
<p>For escape, the spacecraft must have a non-negative total energy:</p>
<p>\[
0 \le \frac{1}{2} m v_{escape}^2 - \frac{GMm}{r}
\]</p>

<p>Algebraic manipulation yields:</p>

<p>\[
v_{escape} = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{r}}
\]</p>


<p>This is the escape velocity. Notice how it is independent of the
  spacecraft’s mass. A feather and a Saturn V rocket require the
  same escape speed (assuming an idealised scenario with no air resistance). Any velocity higher than this may escape.</p>


<p>Physics is democratic. Engineering is not.</p>


<p style="font-size: 1.8em; text-align: left;">
    <strong>For the Earth</strong>
</p>

<p>\[
v_{escape} = 11.2 \text{km/s}
\]</p>

<p>That’s very fast. And, indeed, this is a vast underestimate, for to actually escape the Earth’s gravitational vice, 
  one must overcome air resistance and other non-gravitational factors.</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.8em; text-align: left;">
    <strong>Where science fiction cheats:</strong>
</p>    
    
<p>In classic space opera, ships effortlessly drift from planet to planet with limited acceleration phase. In reality, 
  enormous energy expenditure is required to just leave the ground.</p>

<p>Harder science fiction may depict this.</p>

<p>Escape velocity is thus the first tyranny of space.</p>

<p>The second is worse…</p>
