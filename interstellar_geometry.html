    <h2 class="section-heading">The Geometry Behind the Portal</h2>

<p>
  The simplest mathematical description of a wormhole is from Morris &amp; Thorne<sup>4</sup>:
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  $$ ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2 + \frac{dr^2}{1 - \frac{b(r)}{r}} + r^2 d\Omega^2 $$
</p>

<p>
  Without getting weighed down by all the mathematics, this equation can be thought of as a blueprint for the shape of spacetime.
  The first term describes how time behaves, and the final term ensures that the wormhole is spherically symmetric. 
  But what we want to focus on is the middle fraction. The $b(r)$ term acts as a “shape function” and determines how spacetime curves 
  as you move radially inwards. As $\frac{b(r)}{r}$ approaches one, spacetime stretches towards infinity<sup>4</sup>. 
  The smallest radius at which this occurs is the <strong>throat radius</strong>, the narrowest part of the wormhole.
  In the original paper, the equation is a little longer and includes a redshift function $\Phi(r)$, but here 
  we just want to look at a simplified version where it is 0. This will let us focus on the geometry controlled by the shape function $b(r)$.
</p>

<p>
  On the interactive graph you can look at how space stretches as throat radius changes, and this change has very real physical consequences.

<p>
  <strong>Firstly, tidal acceleration.</strong> Even in everyday gravity, different parts of your body feel slightly different gravitational pulls. 
  Your feet are pulled a little more strongly towards the Earth than your head. In extreme gravitational environments, that difference becomes dramatic. 
  This stretching effect is known as tidal force. Near a small wormhole throat, spacetime is so sharply curved that the difference in gravitational pull 
  between the front and back of a spacecraft could become enormous<sup>4</sup>. For the astronauts in <em>Interstellar</em>, 
  a throat that is too small would mean being violently stretched or compressed during passage. 
  Increasing the throat radius reduces these tidal effects, making the journey survivable.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Secondly, curvature strength.</strong> In general relativity, gravity is not a force but curvature. 
  The sharper the curvature, the more extreme the gravitational environment. A smaller throat radius means spacetime bends more abruptly<sup>4</sup>. 
  On the graph, this appears as a rapid rise in curvature as the throat narrows. For astronauts, stronger curvature means stronger gravitational gradients, 
  greater structural stress on the spacecraft, and a much narrower margin for safe travel.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Finally, required negative energy density.</strong> To hold a wormhole open, the equations demand the presence of exotic matter, 
  which is matter with negative energy density<sup>4</sup>. This is not something we encounter in ordinary life. It represents a form of energy that 
  would behave oppositely to normal matter, effectively pushing spacetime outward to prevent collapse. 
  As the throat radius increases, the amount of this negative energy required decreases<sup>4</sup>. 
  In practical terms, a larger wormhole is not only safer, but it is easier to construct and stabilise.
</p>

<p>
  The graph reveals something important: these effects do not increase gently. As the throat radius shrinks, tidal acceleration, curvature, 
  and required negative energy all rise steeply. A wormhole that looks only slightly narrower on screen may, in reality, be dramatically more hostile.
</p>

<p>
  In <em>Interstellar</em>, the wormhole is large enough for a spacecraft to pass safely<sup>1</sup>. That is a narrative choice. No wormhole is inherently
  safe and easy to construct and this why the film explains that the wormhole has been placed by a more advanced future civilisation. The geometry encoded in 
  the equation does not forbid such a wormhole, but it does require conditions that are extremely difficult to realise in practice.
