      <strong>Where Physics and Fiction Meet</strong>
    </p>
    <h2>Historical context: wormholes in science fiction</h2>

    <p>
      Long before <em>Interstellar</em>, science fiction regularly used “shortcuts through space” to solve the narrative problem of interstellar distance.
      Early stories often described tunnels, gates, or hyperspace corridors without committing to a specific physical mechanism. As general relativity became
      more widely popularised, the Einstein–Rosen bridge gradually became a convenient scientific-looking language for the same idea: a path between distant
      regions of spacetime that avoids the long journey in between.<sup>7</sup>
    </p>

    <p>
      By the late twentieth century, wormholes had become an established device across both literature and screen. Novels such as <em>Contact</em> used a
      wormhole transit system explicitly, and are particularly notable because the fictional mechanism was shaped by real consultation: Kip Thorne advised
      Carl Sagan on what relativistic theory could plausibly permit, and encouraged the shift from a black-hole transit to a wormhole-based one in order to
      avoid obvious physical contradictions.<sup>8</sup><sup>9</sup> In television, franchises including <em>Stargate</em> and <em>Babylon 5</em> helped
      cement wormholes and “jump points” as familiar visual shorthand for fast interstellar travel.<sup>7</sup>
    </p>

    <p>
      This matters for <em>Interstellar</em> because it arrives after wormholes were already culturally familiar, but it treats the idea differently.
      Rather than using a wormhole purely as a plot device, the film makes its credibility depend on whether the geometry, lensing, and constraints can be
      traced back to real general relativity. In other words, it inherits a long science-fiction tradition, but then tries to “pay” for the shortcut using
      actual physics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Interstellar’s significance lies not only in what it shows on screen, but in where those ideas come from. The wormhole is not an invention
      of the film; it emerges from a line of thinking that began with Einstein’s description of gravity<sup>2</sup>, continued through decades of
      theoretical work, and was developed more rigorously by Morris and Thorne<sup>4</sup>. Rather than creating new physics for dramatic effect,
      the film adopted existing theory and accepted its constraints<sup>1</sup>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The influence also moved in the opposite direction. In order to visualise curved spacetime accurately, the production relied on detailed
      relativistic calculations that later formed the basis of published research<sup>6</sup>. The relationship between physics and fiction was
      therefore not one-sided. The theory shaped the story, and the demands of the story required the theory to be expressed with unusual clarity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Interstellar does not present a wormhole as effortless or inevitable. It presents it as something permitted by equations that have been tested,
      debated, and refined for over a century. In doing so, it illustrates that scientific development and imagination are not opposing forces, but part
      of the same ongoing conversation, one in which fiction can clarify theory just as theory constrains fiction.
